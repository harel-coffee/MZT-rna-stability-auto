2. This reviewer understands that codon optimality here was estimated in a holistic sense at the gene level. Since the regulatory effect of codons is translation-dependent, how does the relative position of optimal codons (and non-optimal codons) (ie, 5' end vs. 3'end) affect mRNA stability in this context of early embryogenesis?
