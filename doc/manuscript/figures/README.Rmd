In this folder I make the figures for the paper.

## Fig.1 Codon composition strongly predicts mRNA stability

Rationale: Codon optimality is an strong regulatory mechanism, therefore can we predict
maternal mRNA decay based on the codon composition

###  A)	Carton alpha amanitin (Ariel)

### B) Half-life or decay distribution

```{r 1b}
knitr::include_graphics("fig01/figures/f01_decaydistribution-1.png")
```



## C) Model to predict mRNA decay in alpha (scatter plot, R and P value), How much can you explain

```{r 1c, fig.cap="Test Data Predictions"}
knitr::include_graphics("fig01/figures/f01_mdl_test_data_predictions-1.png")
```


### D) Calculate the mRNA decay of the 1nt out of frame (codon vs nt) 

```{r 1d, fig.cap="Endogenous genes are shown in the background"}
knitr::include_graphics("fig01/figures/f01_reporters_predictions-1.png")
```

## Supplementary Figure 1

### a) PCA wild type and alpha (evidence it is a good dataset) (Santi)


```{r s1a}
knitr::include_graphics("../../../results/19-01-10-EDA-RNA-time-course/figures/pca-1.png")
```

### b) Scatter plot, alpha vs wildtype for each point (evidence zygotic expression blocked)

```{r s1b}
knitr::include_graphics("../../../results/19-01-10-EDA-RNA-time-course/figures/bivariate_polyA-1.png")
```
