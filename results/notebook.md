In this notebook I record my daily progress in detail. This notebook should record my observations.

-   Created directory organization based on [Noble 2009](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000424)
-   Started version control with git. I host a private [github repo](https://github.com/santiago1234/MZT-rna-stability)
-   Downloaded mRNA seq time courses generated by the lab.

I have to re-run previews analysis and do some quality checks on this data. Ariel suggested to do: PCA, poly-A vs ribo (also the ratio) and then the model.
