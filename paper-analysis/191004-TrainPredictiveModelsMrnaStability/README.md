# Evaluate models

Here, I train a variety of machine learning models.

The following scripts train the models:

+ *01_LinearModels.py* Linear models
+ *02_NonLinearModels.py* Non-linear, knn and SVMs
+ *03_TreesEnsemblsModels.py* Tree models and Ensemble methods

All the evaluated models are saved to *results_data/trained_models/* using joblib.
Also, the predictions for each model on the test data are saved *results_data/val_\**
