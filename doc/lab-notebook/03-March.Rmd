## Evolutionary Pressure Analysis

### 19-03-19

The goal here is to see if the optimality (PLS1) is distributed differentially across 3' UTR
regulatory groups (m6a, MiR-430). For this analysis, I divided the genes into 4 groups, (see boxplot) then I compare the optimality level (PLS1) across the groups.

```{r 4a}
knitr::include_graphics("../../results/19-03-20-EvolutionaryPreassure/figures/4aOptimalityBoxplot-1.png")
```

Then I fitted the following herarchical model.

$$
PLS1 \sim Normal(\mu_i, \sigma) \\
\mu_i = \alpha_{grp_{[i]}}
$$

The following plots shows the estimate for the groups and a 95%CI, the unpooled estimate is shown (black circle). The pvalue is shown on the left, this p.value was computed with a anova test comparing against the null model (complete pooling).

```{r model}
