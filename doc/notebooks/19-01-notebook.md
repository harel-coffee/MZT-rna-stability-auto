In this notebook I record my daily progress in detail. This notebook should record
my observations.

***
### 19-01-09

+ Created directory organization based on [Noble 2009](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000424)
+ Started version control with git. I host a private [github repo](https://github.com/santiago1234/MZT-rna-stability)
+ Downloaded mRNA seq time courses generated by the lab.

I have to re-run previews analysis and do some quality checks on this data. Ariel suggested to do: PCA, poly-A vs ribo (also the ratio) and then the model.

### 19-01-10

+ Run Exploratory analysis for RNA-seq time course (PCA), the PCA analysis looks find.

I also generated the following bi-variate distribution: ![](../../results/19-01-10-EDA-RNA-time-course/figures/bivariate_polyA-1.png)

- For the alpha-amanitin-time course I have to see what is the best way to perform the SPIKE-in normalization, I can
  ask Ariel or Comp-Bio. Also the following paper by [Risso](https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.2931) can be useful to read.

#### Estimating decay rate a-amanitin data

Today I focus on getting the decay rate estimates. The following are things to keep in mind:

1. filter the noise (low expressed genes could be just noise)
2. I am not using the SPIKE-IN normalization, so I am getting a decay rate in step of half-life.
3. I can do pooling with a hierarchical model to account for noise. I will give a try.

To account for the noise I filter out low expressed genes, and this was done with the ZFPKM package to detect the active genes. The following plot shows the distribution of the genes after filtering. ![](../../results/19-01-11-GetDecayRateFromTimeCourse/figures/active_genes-1.png)

I fitted a log-linear model to the TPM to get the estimates. The followuing plot shows the bi-variate distribution of the model parameters. ![](../../results/19-01-11-GetDecayRateFromTimeCourse/figures/get_estimates-1.png)

Note that at low expression the beta estimates tend to be more positve, this can be do to noise, consider filtering genes with alpha > 0.
