### Overview

In this notebook, I will plot the regulatory profile in the new RNA-seq data of the k-mers that were proviously identified.

### Conclusions

We can see that the two stabilizing elements look promising and the un-stabilizing are not. After a discussion with Ariel, I find a new model that can be extremely useful to identify potential regulatory factors. This model has discussed it in the lab notebook.
