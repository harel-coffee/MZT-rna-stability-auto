## mRNA-seq profiles

This data was generated by the Bazzini lab.

### Data Sets

+ MOLNG-2541: [Zebrafish_MZT_RiboZero](https://lims.stowers.org/#/molecular-biology/ngs/requests/MOLNG-2541), wild type ribo-zero profile.

+ MOLNG-2540: [Zebrafish_MZT_Poly](https://lims.stowers.org/#/molecular-biology/ngs/requests/MOLNG-2540), wild type poly-A profile.

+ MOLNG-2539: [Zebrafish_alpha_timecourse](https://lims.stowers.org/#/molecular-biology/ngs/requests/MOLNG-2539), alpha-amanitin poly-A time course,
for this experiment there is also an spikein count.


NOTE: for these data-sets I downloaded the RSEM tpm tables.

The script *get_files.sh* will download this data and generate a folder.
