## M6A data

I created the following link to a dir containing the m6A data:

```bash
ln -s ../../../181029-Paper/data/rna-time-course/m6A-data/ m6A-data
```

We were skeptic about the m6a targets. Ariel suggested that the paper is not very high quality and their targets may have been right. To test this hypothesis, I took the mutant and wt data for ydhtf. I estimated the difference in expression level for the genes that are targets. A difference indicates that the genes are affected by the treatment. The analysis suggests that the genes are  m6a targets.
