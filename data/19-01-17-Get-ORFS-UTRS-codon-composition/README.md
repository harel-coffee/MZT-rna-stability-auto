# Retrieve sequence data

Here, I retrieve the sequence data (coding dna and 3' UTR) for z. fish genes. *fish_seq_data_cds_3utr.csv*

Also the codon composition is computed. *zfish_codon_composition.csv*

Note: the data sets are in the folder: **sequence-data**

```

reproduce the analysis

```bash
sh  runall.sh
