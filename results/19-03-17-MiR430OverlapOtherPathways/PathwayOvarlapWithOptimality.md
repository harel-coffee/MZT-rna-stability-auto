### Overview

Do we see an overlap of codon optimality with other pathways? aka Do optimality affect MiR430 and m6A targets?Do we see an overlap of codon optimality with other pathwats?


I will define optimal/non-optimal genes in the following way:

+ top 1k lowest PLS1 (non-optimal)
+ top 1k highest PLS1 (optimal)
