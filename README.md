This repository contains data and programs for the analysis found in "The crosstalk between codon optimality and 3' UTR cis-elements dictates mRNA stability" by Santiago Gerardo Medina, Gopal Kushawah, María José Blanco Salazar, and Ariel A Bazzini


### Project Organization

This project is organized as suggested by [Nobble 2009](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000424).

#### **data |** the data-sets of the project.

Here, you can find some the data sets used in the analysis. For published data go to the folder: [data/00-00-00-PublishedData/](/data/00-00-00-PublishedData). For a detailed description of each dataset check the readme file: [/data/00-00-00-PublishedData/README.md](/data/00-00-00-PublishedData/README.md).

+ **results |** here is where the computational analysis are performed, each analysis is a folder named
in chronological order
+ **doc |** the project documentation, here also there is a subfolder called notebook, in this folder I keep
my lab notebook that tracks my daily progress and ideas or everthing usefull. There is a notebook per month.
+ **src |** projects scripts if I need to create a pipeline it goes here.
