## Protocol

### 1.  Obtain a numerical estimate of codon optimality

** 01-getOptimalityPLS.R |** For each specie decompose the codon space using
the PLS method. The response variable is the decay rate from the mRNA stability
profiles.For human all the profiles are decompose together. Also for fish and 
xenoupus the profiles are decompose together.
