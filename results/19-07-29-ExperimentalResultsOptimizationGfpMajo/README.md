# Majo Experimental Validation of GFP mRNA stability optimization

Here, we tested the effect of 4 GFP sequences:

+ eGFP -> optimized GFP
+ neutral GFP -> regular GFP
+ suprema GFP -> optimized with our method
+ infima GFP -> deoptimized GFP with our method


Data (tables):

+ **SecondQuantificationFinalGFPs.xlsx |** Final GFP quantification (intensity GFP/mcherry).
+ **firstQuantificationGFPs.xlsx |** First quants same format, Majo says high standard error


# Majo Final Results


The final data Majo generated is in the bazzini lab folder: `/Volumes/bazzinilab/Members/Majo/FINAL_RESULTS`

Also the plots for figure 3 are there.
