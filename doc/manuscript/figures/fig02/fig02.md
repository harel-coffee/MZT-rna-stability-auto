B)	Apply your model to MZT (wildtype) (scatter plot, R and P value), How much can you explain. Color code Optimal, non-optimla, miR430 and add the median of each group

Thinks to keep in mind:

+ I will take the log2 fold change between 2 and 6 hrs.
+ I define optimal genes bassed on PLS1 (top 500)
+ MiR430 bassed in 6-mer presence
